# PGO Manifests

## Overview

This repository contains my postgres operator manifest files for my [home cluster](https://github.com/budimanjojo/home-cluster).
Manifests are fetched from [postgres-operator-example](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator-examples).
Github Action is used to update the manifest files once a week.
The reason I'm doing this is to workaround my [issue](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator-examples/issues/90) with that repository.
Once there's a better solution, this repository will be dropped forever.
